# 1. A train arrives at a station uniformly between 8:00 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. Let the
# random variable X represent the number of minutes the train arrives after 8:00
# a.m. What is the probability that the train arrives between 8:10 a.m. and 8:25 a.m.?

# P(10 <= X <= 25)    (uniform distribution)

# 2. The time (in hours) to complete a software update is exponentially distributed
# with rate Î» = 1/3 . Find the probability that an update will take at most 2 hours.

# P(X <= 2)   (exponential distribution)

# 3. Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard
# deviation of 15.

# i. What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ above 130?

# mean = 100
# sd = 15

#P(X > 130) = 1 - P(X <= 130)
          # = 
              1 - pnorm(130 , mean = 100 , sd = 15 , lower.tail = TRUE)

# or

#P(X > 130)  = 
             pnorm(130 , mean = 100 , sd = 15 , lower.tail = FALSE)
             
             


# ii. What IQ score represents the 95th percentile?
